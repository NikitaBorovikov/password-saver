# REST API for secure storage and generation of new passwords
## Description
This API is designed to help users securely store, manage, and generate strong passwords for their accounts. Built with security as a top priority, this project uses ```AES-128-GCM``` encryption to ensure that your sensitive information remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access. 

## Features
- üîí Secure password storage with AES-128-GCM encryption
- üîë Password generation with customizable complexity
- üõ°Ô∏è Protection at every stage
- üì¶ Clean architecture implementation
- üîÑ Session-based authentication

## Security Overview

### Authentication & Sessions
- **Secure Session Management**: Uses Gorilla Sessions with cryptographically random session IDs
- **Cookie Security**: HttpOnly and SameSite flags enabled
- **No Password Storage**: Only encrypted password data is stored

### Data Protection
- **AES-128-GCM Encryption**: For both passwords and service names
- **Separate Encryption Keys**: Different keys for different data types
- **Secure Key Management**: Via environment variables (.env)

### API Security
- **Zero Sensitive Data Exposure**: In responses or errors
- **Input Validation**: Protection against injection attacks
