# REST API for secure storage and generation of new passwords
## Description
This API is designed to help users securely store, manage, and generate strong passwords for their accounts. Built with security as a top priority, this project uses ```AES-128-GCM``` encryption to ensure that your sensitive information remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access. 

## Features
- üîí Secure password storage with AES-128-GCM encryption
- üîë Password generation with customizable complexity
- üõ°Ô∏è Protection at every stage
- üì¶ Clean architecture implementation
- üîÑ Session-based authentication

## Security Overview

### Authentication & Sessions
- **Secure Session Management**: Uses Gorilla Sessions with cryptographically random session IDs
- **Cookie Security**: HttpOnly and SameSite flags enabled
- **No Password Storage**: Only encrypted password data is stored

### Data Protection
- **AES-128-GCM Encryption**: For both passwords and service names
- **Separate Encryption Keys**: Different keys for different data types
- **Secure Key Management**: Via environment variables (.env)

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DDoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Protection against injection attacks
- **Zero Sensitive Data Exposure**: In responses or errors

## Getting Started
- Go(version 1.23 or higher)
- Docker
- Make (optional)

## Installation
### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/NikitaBorovikov/password-saver.git
cd password-saver
```
### 2. Environment Setup
This project uses two environment files:
- ```.env``` - for <b>production</b>
- ```.env.dev``` - for <b>development</b>

Copy the template from the repository:
```
cp env.example .env       # For production
cp env.example .env.dev   # For development
```
Open the .env file and fill in the required values:
Open ```.env``` and ```.env.dev``` files and fill in the required values.

### 3. Build and run the application:
Build the docker image:
```
 docker build -t password-saver-app .  
```
Run the application:
```
docker-compose up
```
The server will be running on port ```8081```

### 4. Run db migration
If the application is being launched for the first time, migrations must be applied to the database:
```
make migrate
```
